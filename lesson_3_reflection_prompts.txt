When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working with a group of people then using remote repositories become
    essential as multiple people can work on the same project and commit their changes to
    one secure location. Another advantage of using remote repositories over keeping all of
    my work local is the safety of a backup. The chances of a repository being lost
    from a server such as Github is much lower than the same files being lost or corrupted
    due to faults in my local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
